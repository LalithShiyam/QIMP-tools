# COCOA: COnverting low-dose CT images tO MR Attenuation maps.

This program converts low-dose CT images (from Siemens mCT) to CT attenuation maps with MR attenuation map headers from the Siemens Biograph mMR. The idea is to replace the sub-optimal MR-attenuation maps with CT-attenuation maps while retaining the original MR attenuation map headers. This is crucial for performing offline PET reconstructions.
